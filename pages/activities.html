          <p>
            Our club hosts hands-on workshops, project-building sessions, and
            code reviews to strengthen members' web development skills. From
            mastering front-end frameworks to back-end development and
            full-stack projects, we encourage learning by doing. Members also
            participate in group projects to create real-world applications,
            enhancing their understanding of modern web technologies.
